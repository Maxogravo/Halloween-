<h1>Halloween</h1>
<h2>Source Coming Soon</h2>
Halloween is a game that I made from pygame a few years ago.
It was one of the first projects I created without any help.

Halloween is a simple, endless game where ghost fall fown the screen and 
you have to dodge them. There are also pieces of CandyCorn to collect as power ups.

<h2>License</h2>
Halloween is completely open source meaning you can do whatever you like with it.
