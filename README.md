<h1>Halloween</h1>
<h2>Source Coming Soon</h2>
Halloween is a game that I made from pygame a few years ago.
It was one of the first projects I created without any help.

Halloween is a simple, endless game where ghosts fall down the screen and 
you have to dodge them. There are also pieces of CandyCorn to collect as power ups.
After each set of ghosts hit the bottom of the screen, you gain 1 point. Every candy corn is 5

Halloween is completely open source meaning you can do whatever you like with it.
